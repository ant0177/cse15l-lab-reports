## Step #2: Remotely Connecting
We will be remotely connecting from our computer to a server using SSH (Secure Socket Shell) To do this we will be using the terminal in VS Code. 

1. Open a new terminal in VS Code, click "Terminal" on the top bar and then "New Terminal" 
2. Use the SSH command with your personal account information and enter your password.
```
ssh cs15lspaqx@ieng6@ucsd.edu
```
3. If it is your first time connecting you will likely see a message and in return just type yes.
4. After, a message will be displayed saying your are logged in.
